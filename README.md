# Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection Design Pattern In PHP

using this design pattern , Objects can receive other objects that it depends on

all diffrent objects shares a unique base interface and by using this interface

you can pass New Objects to Main Object , which will include all required methods and props

is this example I simulated a Gamepad builder Which you can easily add new Gamepads without any complexity
